Thanks to this __Fabric API__, enriching your chaincodes with external data using __Oraclize__ is very easy!

In Golang it is as simple as importing the __`oraclize/fabric-api`__ that you'll find in this repository.

This will provide your contract with functions like __`OraclizeQuery_sync(...)`__, which make it trivial for you to leverage our oracle technology straight away.

Simply import __Oraclize__ into your contract like so:

```golang

import (
  oraclizeapi "github.com/oraclize/fabric-api"
)
```

Simply install the Oraclize Connector chaincode on your peer.

To learn more about the Oraclize Fabric integration, please refer to our __[documentation here](http://docs.oraclize.it/#fabric)__.

### :computer: See It In Action!

For working examples of how to integrate the __Oraclize__ Fabric API into your own chaincodes, head on over to the __[Oraclize Fabric Examples](https://github.com/oraclize/fabric-examples)__ repository. Here you'll find various examples that use __Oraclize__ to feed smart-contracts with data from a variety of external sources.
